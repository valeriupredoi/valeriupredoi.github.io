### 7th ENES HPC Workshop Barcelona 2022
- open when: **Monady, 9 May 2022**
- duration: **May 09, 2022 09:00 AM to May 11, 2022 05:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

The 7th ENES HPC workshop will take place as an hybrid event at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC, Barcelona) from Monday, May 9 to Wednesday, May 11 2022.

**Find all the information and registration details on the [ENES Portal](https://portal.enes.org/community/community-workshops/7th-enes-hpc-workshop-barcelona-2022)**

IS-ENES3 organises this workshop of the European Network for Earth System modelling (ENES) in collaboration with [ESiWACE2](https://www.esiwace.eu/). It will gather experts on HPC in earth system modelling at an hybrid event. A streaming service for remote participants (including speakers) will be available but after those 2 years of very scarce social interactions due to the pandemic, we strongly encourage everyone to travel and physically attend the workshop.

Building on the previous ENES HPC workshops (Lecce, 2011 & 2018; Toulouse, 2013 & 2016; Hamburg, 2014 & 2020), the talks are structured in five sessions:

Session no. | Session name
:----------:|:------------:
Session 1 | European and International HPC Landscape
Session 2 | Mix traditional modeling with Machine Learning 
Session 3 | Performance
Session 4 | Heterogeneous architectures (accelerators)
Session 5 | Data Worflows

### <a name="isenes3ga1"></a>IS-ENES3 virtual First General Assembly
- open when: **Mar 25, 2020**
- duration: **Mar 25, 2020 to Mar 27, 2020 (Europe/Vienna / UTC100)**

The IS-ENES3 Virtual First General Assembly was held on the 25th-27th of March 2020. Initially planned in Toulouse (Centre International de Conférences), the Covid-19 situation compelled the project to turn it into a remote meeting. More than 100 persons joined throughout the three days to attend presentations of the project activities (organized in sessions according to the three main themes: Data, metadata and software; Models, tools and HPC; model Evaluation) and participate to discussions on various topics.

### Workshop "Climate indices - Eastern European perspective"
**Sep 27, 2021** from 11:00 AM to 03:00 PM

![EEclimateindicesworkshop]((../images/Eastern_Europe_banner_vf.png)

The IS-ENES3 consortium organizes an online workshop ‘Climate indices - Eastern European perspective’. The workshop will **be an online effort to collect information on the current status about usage and implementation of different climate indices in the region, which will be the starting point to draft requirements and recommendations for the future**. It will be organized as two online meetings, combined with online surveys and online interviews between them.

- **Initial meeting**: 17th May, 2021 (9:30 AM to 12:00 PM CEST)
- **Survey and interview** : June and July, 2021
- **Final workshop**: 27th September, 2021 (11:00 AM to 3:00 PM CEST)

**The aim of the workshop?** Used by a broad user community for many applications outside the climate science community, climate indices provide compact information on key physical parameters. A reference specification of the indices has been developed by joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and these have been implemented in the ICCLIM tool and many others. The workshop will evaluate and review the usage of existing indices and explore the need for additional ones in these broader and new communities.

**Who organizes it?**  Researchers from the IS-ENES3 consortium. These researchers will interact directly with the workshop participants. Beside many activities, IS-ENES3 project aims at further engaging with the community of users of IS-ENES services, by widening the user base through training, engaging the community in co-constructing standards and expressing needs, and engaging the younger generation in interdisciplinary approaches.

**For whom?** This workshop is for climate scientists and researchers from different disciplines (agriculture, forestry, water resources, public health etc) that often use different climate indices. We aim to create a mix of different disciplines so that recommendations will follow needs from broad research communities.

**What is the programme?** The initial online meeting will be organized to present the main goals and planned output of the final workshop together with the discussion on current status and potential future developments. After the meeting the online survey will be initialized together with online interviews, from which a set of recommendations will be drafted. The topics related to the climate indices that will be covered are: indices definition and usage, data sources, software for calculation and visualization, current gaps and limitations.
