#### <a name="virt-clinic"></a>IS-ENES3: Virtual clinic on bias-adjustment of climate model data
- open when: **Oct 14, 2021**
- duration: **Oct 14, 2021 10:00 AM to Oct 21, 2021 12:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

**Dates of the clinic**

The virtual clinic is divided into two meetings.
- 14th October 2021 10:00-12:00 CET
- 21st October 2021 10:00-12:00 CET

##### Background

For many studies on the impacts of climate change, bias-adjustment of the climate model simulations is a necessary step before impact models can be run or before relevant climate indices can be calculated. However, there are many methods, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. As part of the IS-ENES3 project, 3 courses on “Climate data for impact assessments” were organized, in which also some attention was paid to bias-adjustment (by Ana Casanueva, University of Cantabria). However, it was clear that the participants of the schools wanted some more in-depth information and practical exercises.

##### Who can participate

Everyone interested ! However, the workshop is meant especially for **climate researchers, impact researchers and climate service providers** who may have to do bias-adjustments or use/will use bias-adjusted climate model data.

##### Set-up the clinic

- During the first meeting, two experts in the field of bias-adjustments will give more in-depth information about e.g. quantile mapping, bias adjustment of precipitation, multivariate methods, challenges, limitations and pitfalls and non-stationary methods.
- In between the two meetings, participants are asked to either explore some tools, do an exercise that will be provided or send in an example/problem/question from their own work on bias adjustments or with bias-adjusted data.
- During the second meeting, problems and challenges of participants with bias-adjustments will be discussed, either from their own work, tools they used or the exercise that was provided during the first meeting.

##### Speakers

- **Mathieu Vrac**: Head of the ESTIMR (Extremes - Statistics - Impacts - Regionalization) group, Directeur de Recherches CNRS (Senior Research scientist) at LSCE-IPSL/CNRS
- **Douglas Maraun**: Associate Professor at the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change and head of the Regional Climate Research Group at the University of Graz

**Register** [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdChe9gsMkxACd4_Muny9yz5SbmwN820OsPbwWR6RmxEP-DdA/viewform) before October 12!
