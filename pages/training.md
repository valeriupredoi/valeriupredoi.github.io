### Current

#### IS-ENES3 Eastern Europe Spring Schools on Climate data and Impact assessments
- open when: **May 17, 2022**
- duration: **May 17, 2022 08:30 AM to May 19, 2022 07:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

The Babeș-Bolyai University (BBU), Faculty of Geography, in collaboration with IS-ENES3, organises two parallel schools (with one common day) targeted to climate and impact researchers from Eastern Europe on 17-19th May 2022 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

Climate change is seen as one of the biggest challenges in our times. To be able to do climate change impact studies and to adapt to climate change the knowledge of many different disciplines is needed and knowledge on climate data and experience on analyzing and processing climate data is needed. During the spring school, organised by the Babeş-Bolyai University and the IS-ENES3 project, climate and impact researchers and students will be able to get practical experience with analyzing and processing climate data and with working together on an impact study.

The aim of the schools is to:

- get more knowledge about the various types of climate data and tools/methods to analyse/process them and get experience in using these tools/methods/data;
- learn what is needed for interdisciplinary impact/adaptation studies on climate change;
- create/broaden network on climate change and impact assessments

**The programme, practical details information and application procedure are available on the** [BBU website](https://geografie.ubbcluj.ro/cercetare/?page_id=557).

#### IS-ENES3 Data Science Summer School
- open when: **Sep 01, 2022**
- duration: **Sep 01, 2022 09:00 AM to Sep 07, 2022 05:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

:--------------:|:------------:
What: | One week, fully funded Summer School
When: | September 1-7, 2022
Where: | Athens, Greece
Fee: | Free of charge

Organised by the [IS-ENES3 consortium](https://valeriupredoi.github.io/partners/), this school aims to increase expertise and skills on theoretical and practical concepts of Data Science, building upon and mainly targeting how to accelerate scientific discovery from data. Early stage researchers will learn how to analyse, visualise and report on massive datasets, in the scientific domain as well as how to apply data-intensive and data-oriented paradigms and solutions to address scientific discovery in climate science.

Driven by the theoretical background provided by domain, data and computer science experts, the school will adopt a hands-on approach for maximising results focusing on the usage of datasets linked to the IS-ENES3 data services. The school will strengthen the individual expertise of the participating climate and computer scientists, as well as, leverage and emphasise the need of collaboration between them, helping early career scientists with different backgrounds to meet and network.
