### IPCC Data Distribution Centre

The IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC-DDC) provides
- Data used as input to the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth IPCC Assessment Report
- Socio-economic data and scenarios for the impact community: population, economic development, technology, and natural resources
- Visualization service

Find more about ENES data infrastructure (IS-ENES) services for the IPCC-DDC here.


### Long term archival 

Data curation for storage periods longer than 10 years ensures the ongoing retrievability and usability of the data and the accompanying metadata. Easily find and retrieve data via various search portals: [CERA](https://www.wdc-climate.de/ui/), [GISC](https://gisc.dwd.de/wisportal/#), [EUDAT](https://sp.eudat.eu/catalog/resources/33bc21d5-f53d-4eed-9a15-56f98f5c7f69), or [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/). 

### Alternatives Access points

Attention: this page is currently under development - information will be updated soon.

Some ESGF partners have additional access points to data (download might require a specific account).

**WDCC and DDC**
World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) offers download of CMIP5 replicas for the following models, usually the newest version of the data:

HadCM3  HadGEM2-A  HadGEM2-ES  inmcm4  IPSL-CM5A-LR  MIROC4h  MIROC5  MPI-ESM-LR  MPI-ESM-MR  MPI-ESM-P  MRI-AGCM3-2H  MRI-AGCM3-2S  MRI-CGCM3  NorESM1-M  NorESM1-ME

The CMIP5 data in the reference archive of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC-DDC) at the World Data Centre for Climate (WDCC) is also accessible. Full list of available CMIP5 data at the [IPCC-DCC website](https://www.ipcc-data.org/sim/gcm_monthly/AR5/Reference-Archive.html). Find information describing search and access at the How-To page. As WDCC is a different data management system, ESGF OpenIDs cannot be used here and users need to register at WDCC at DKRZ. Please refer to [https://cera-www.dkrz.de/WDCC/ui/cerasearch/](https://www.wdc-climate.de/ui/) for more information.

**About WDCC**
The WDCC includes intense data curation for storage periods longer than 10 years to ensure the ongoing retrievability and usability of the data and the accompanying metadata. Both data and metadata undergo meticulous technical quality checks and data publication service grants permanent accessibility by assigning unique persistent identifier DOI to data and metadata.

**Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)**
It is freely available and functions as a one-stop shop to explore climate data. [Register for free](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register) to obtain access to the [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/vision) and its Toolbox.

**CEDA**
CMIP5 data are available via CEDA data services. Register and apply for access to CMIP5 data (only for non-commercial research and educational purposes).
Once you have received e-mail notification that your application has been granted (within 1 day of receipt of your application, subject to eligibility), you will be able to access and download the data via our FTP server:  details of this and other access services

Some details about the CMIP5 dataset can be found at:

**NCAR**
The NCAR hosted CCSM4 and CESM1 CMIP5 data is available from the ESG-NCAR Climate Data Gateway CMIP5 project. Users may need to create a new account for access.

**NOAA**
NOAA has another data portal that hosts NOAA GFDL data.  Its top level is http://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/  with a section for CMIP5 data.  All the
data is available to everyone; no account needed.

**NCI**
As ACCESS1.0, ACCESS1.3 and CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 are all unrestricted (available for both research and commercial use) NCI has made the data available on the NCI THREDDS service with agreement from the modelling groups.

There is currently no search interface, so manual (or programmatic Wget) access are the only viable options, but we thought better to have it available on some level than not at all. No account is needed.

Please report any problems in this data service to help@nci.org.au

**CCCma**
CCCma CMIP5 data can be found at:
