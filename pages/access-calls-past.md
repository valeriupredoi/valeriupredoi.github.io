#### <a name="oasis"></a>IS-ENES3 3rd call for an OASIS Dedicated User Support (closing January 15th)
- open when: **Th, 25. Nov 2021**
- duration: **Nov 25, 2021 10:00 AM to Jan 15, 2022 11:00 AM**

Within IS-ENES3, work-package 6 "Services on European ESMs and Software Tool", a Trans-National Access action, proposes to provide technical help to upgrade the code or enhance computing performance of OASIS3-MCT based coupled models.

This year, a total of 3 person-months of Dedicated User Support will be offered to 3 different groups. Provided by CERFACS, this service is available to any climate research laboratory in Europe. This service excludes the scientific development, tuning, analysis and evaluation of the coupled model components themselves and of the coupled model as a whole. At the moment, difficult traveling conditions forbid to give this service on site. This additional constraint leads to favor short and well-defined tasks that can be achieved remotely.

**Application procedure**

- Briefly describe your project and your needs filling the questionnaire "Description of your OASIS project‚Äù (5 pages maximum)
- Send your questionnaire to Eric Maisonnave (eric.maisonnave[at]cerfacs.fr).

The application deadline for this 3rd call is January 15th, 2022.

**Evaluation criteria**

- Conciseness and good definition of the required enhancements or modifications. Developments focused on the OASIS software (instead of model interfaces) will be preferred
- Quality of the methodology proposed
- Expected scientific impact of the target coupled system and its long-term support by the applicant group
- Development of cooperation with communities outside ENES
- Potential training aspects for new or young users
- Synergy with the OASIS3-MCT development plan
- Originality of the problem: e.g. new physics (ice sheets, hydrology, atmosphere/ocean boundary layer, regional modelling, ...), increased task parallelism (extraction and concurrent running of sub-components e.g. sea-ice), etc.

The selection will be made by members of the OASIS Advisory Board. The institutions selected will be notified by the end of February 2022.

*Your personal data (name, surname, e-mail address) will be collected by CERFACS for selecting and maintaining your candidacy. The legal basis of the processing is Article 6 (1) lit. e General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . Your data might be shared among ISENES3 partners and will be deleted at the end of the IS-ENES3 project. In accordance with the European GDPR, you can ask for data rectification, data access and data erasure by contacting Eric Maisonnave (eric.maisonnave[at]cerfacs.fr).*
